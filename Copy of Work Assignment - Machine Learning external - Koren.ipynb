The task is a well known and basic task of speech processing, and is often a preliminary stage before higher-order tasks such as speaker diarization.\n","\n","We are looking at a binary classification task, based on 100 features, extracted from voice recordings of different speakers. The dataset consists of a training set with 1515 audio recordings and a test set with 460 audio recordings. Unfortunately, the names and origins of the features were lost, and we can’t reproduce which features are more or less relevant, and need to learn it from the data.\n","\n","In addition, we don’t have accurate labels - we hired 5 annotators, each with a different level of skill in speaker gender classification, who gave us their best opinions. Since the task is relatively simple, we expect all annotators to be better than chance, but some may be worse than others. We need to decide on a ground truth for the data given the feedback we have.\n","\n","Note that there might not be the same amount of male and female speakers in the training data - it's hard to know exactly without accurate ground truth, but one class seems more populated than the other. Despite this, we want to avoid our classifier having a bias towards one of the classes - we want to be equally accurate on both genders, as in a real world setting we expect the distribution to be more or less 50-50."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xhM2ii2xUp3e"},"source":["## Prerequisites - Importing the Data\n","There is no need to edit this cell - just run it whenever you're using the data to import it into the memory.\n","The local variable *features* contains 1515 examples, each having 100 features each, based on audio recordings of a single speaker each, in the form of a Pandas DataFrame.\n","More about the DataFrame interface can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame).\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"atnRmocoU0Tu"},"source":["import urllib2\n","import zipfile\n","from StringIO import StringIO\n","import pandas as pd\n","from IPython.display import display, HTML\n","\n","response = urllib2.urlopen('https://github.com/augurysys/machine_learning_assignment/raw/master/augury_ml_assignment_2018.zip')\n","augury_ml_assignment_zip = response.read()\n","\n","zip_file_strio = StringIO(augury_ml_assignment_zip)\n","zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_strio)\n","\n","feature_train_csv_data = StringIO(zip_file.read('features_train.csv'))\n","features_train = pd.read_csv(feature_train_csv_data)\n","\n","label_train_csv_data = StringIO(zip_file.read('labels_train.csv'))\n","labels_train = pd.read_csv(label_train_csv_data)\n","\n","feature_test_csv_data = StringIO(zip_file.read('features_test.csv'))\n","features_test = pd.read_csv(feature_test_csv_data)\n","\n","label_test_csv_data = StringIO(zip_file.read('labels_test_true.csv'))\n","labels_test = pd.read_csv(label_test_csv_data)\n","\n","\n","display(features_train)\n","display(labels_train)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"469eImdBCvL4"},"source":["# Assignment\n","\n","Your task is to classify the recordings to the different speaker genders - *male* or *female*.\n","To perform classification, we suggest you use the [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) package, which offers a rich variety of classifiers and regressors, as well as data preprocessing and manupulation tools, performance metrics and more.\n","\n","Please review the code below.
